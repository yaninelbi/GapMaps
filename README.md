DOh!

I imagine this would be a ready boilerpoint for those who wish to create a personalized GPS navigation menu.

For a begining,
I've created the basic functions, including a timer-based GPS tracking function, already integrated to Cordova 2.0 GPS integration.
This will move the man-cursor "automatically" upon movement, based on the current location.
While on movement, a button appears to allow still swapping and navigating on the map, without focusing on the client's location. 

I began to integrate sockets.io with node.js to update the server with the client's location and receive location-based notifications, (like placing new markers on the map).
This will not appear in this repos. because it's still too buggy.

Feel free to fork any changes to prepare the following basic functions:
-Show location name (with locale language support)
-Show path for target location
-Integrating HTML5 sound support, to allow voice commands to be triggered.

P.S.
I'm flying to Thailand for a month this sunday, so don't expact lots of changes while I try to shag my way through the southern islands ;)

Peace -> to the middle east!
